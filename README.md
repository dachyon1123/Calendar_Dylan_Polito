# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This application is a simple calendar application that allows the users to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:
- The time
- A field to hold user input
- A save button

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

The application uses colors to indicate whether a time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This changes depending on the time of day.

## Features
- Simple, clean user interface
- Color-coded time blocks for past, present, and future
- Clickable save button for user input
- Data persists in local storage
